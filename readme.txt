Thanks to Arronsace and NemosMiner --SniffDog-- has been created to Monitor MiningPoolHub.com, Zpool.ca, HashRefinery.com, and Ahashpool.com mining pools in real-time in order to find the most profitable Algo /

Auto Benchmarks Each algo to get optimal speeds and benches throughout monitoring

Fully automated / Set And Forget in Splitsniffin.bat/
Please edit SplitSniffin.bat
SplitSniffCC and SplitSniffEWBF(please set these before you start miner in Splitsniff.bat)

Very Important... SplitsniffCC (ccminer) must use quotation and commas for each GPU selected (ie: '0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7')

Very Important... SplitSniffEWBF (equihash) must use quotation without commas for each GPU selected (ie: '0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7')
(This is how to set for auto convert to btc at Zpool.ca, Hashrefinery.com, and Ahashpool.com)

    Place your Bitcoin address after -u in Splitsniffin.bat

    Passwordcurrency BTC

    Register at Multipool and input your -Username and -Workername to Splitsniffin.bat (your Workername will also be used at hashrefinery and at Zpool for identification of your rig). You must also setup at Miningpoolhub to autoswitch to Bitcoin and place your Bitcoin address in bitcoin tab

This is how to set for a different currency other than btc at Zpool.ca, Hashrefinery.com, and Ahashpool.com

    If you don't want to be paid in Bitcoin at Hashrefinery or Zpool you can choose -Passwordcurrency *Note( Make sure you add same currency wallet address in -u for the same -Passwordcurrency chosen. Auto default is BTC for a BTC wallet address)

Price ticker btc/currency

Choose which Currency you would like bitcoin to be in and stats for that currency "i.e USD, EUR, etc
Algos to bench

*It is very Important at this point to choose algos and then let everything bench first before moving onto pools, intervals, and delays
Pools, Intervals, and Delays

    Then go back into Splitsniffin.bat and select which pool you wish to be at and interval(in seconds) you would like to recheck the pools to see if another algo is worth switching too (Default is 90 seconds)

    Delay(in seconds) for how long before miners switching from 1 instance of algo to another (Default is 1 second)

Go out with your friends and enjoy life! This is designed to catch market rise on coins when you're not there!
