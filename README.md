# SniffDog-Zpool, MiningPoolHub, HashRefinery

*This is Windows software designed for Nvidia 1080ti

Thanks to Arronsace and NemosMiner --SniffDog-- has been created to Monitor MiningPoolHub, Zpool, and HashRefinery mining pools in real-time in order to find the most profitable Algo /

Auto Benchmarks Each algo to get optimal speeds and benches throughout monitoring 

Fully automated / Set And Forget in Splitsniffin.bat/

# Please edit SplitSniffin.bat (This is how to set for auto convert to btc at Zpool and Hashrefinery)

1) Place your Bitcoin address after -u in Splitsniffin.bat

2) Passwordcurrency BTC

2) Register at Multipool and input your -Username and -Workername to Splitsniffin.bat (your Workername will also be used at hashrefinery and at Zpool for identification of your rig). You must also setup at Miningpoolhub to autoswitch to Bitcoin and place your Bitcoin address in bitcoin tab

# This is how to set for a different currency other than btc at Zpool and Hashrefinery

1) If you don't want to be paid in Bitcoin at Hashrefinery or Zpool you can choose -Passwordcurrency *Note( Make sure you add same currency wallet address in -u for the same -Passwordcurrency chosen. Auto default is BTC for a BTC wallet address)

# Price ticker btc/currency

Choose which Currency you would like bitcoin to be in and stats for that currency "i.e USD, EUR, etc

# Algos to bench

*It is very Important at this point to choose algos and then let everything bench first before moving onto pools, intervals, and delays

# Pools, Intervals, and Delays

1) Then go back into Splitsniffin.bat and select which pool you wish to be at and interval(in seconds) you would like to recheck the pools to see if another algo is worth switching too (Default is 90 seconds)

2) Delay(in seconds) for how long before miners switching from 1 instance of algo to another (Default is 1 second)

# SplitSniffCC and SplitSniffEWBF

Very Important... SplitsniffCC (ccminer) must use quotation and commas for each GPU selected (ie: '0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7')

Very Important... SplitSniffEWBF (equihash) must use quotation without commas for each GPU selected (ie: '0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7')

# Go out with your friends and enjoy life! This is designed to catch market rise on coins when you're not there!
